Term Paper
=============

I chose to write a term paper instead of a project.

The content of my term paper is in the file

    content.tex 

Please ensure you have the full version of LaTeX which includes chktex which 
make check calls before you attempt to compile my report.

Compiling the report
--------------------

There is a Makefile in the directory and if you have LaTeX
properly installed you can use it from commandline to create the
report.pdf for my term paper:

    make

As instructed, I did not commit the report.pdf file to the
repository to avoid penalty.
    
Additional packages
------------------------

No additional packages was used for in writing this term paper.
