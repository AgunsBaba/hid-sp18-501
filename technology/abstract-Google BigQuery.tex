Google BigQuery is a cloud-based big data analytics web service for processing very large read-only data sets. BigQuery can analyze data on the order of billions of rows, using a SQL-like syntax. It runs on the Google Cloud Storage infrastructure and can be accessed with a REST-oriented application program interface (API)\cite{TechTarget}.

BigQuery enables the creation of a logical data warehouse over managed, columnar storage as well as data from object storage, and spreadsheets. It also allows the capture and analysis of data in real-time using its powerful streaming ingestion\cite{GoogleCP_BQ}.
